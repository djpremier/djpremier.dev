## 📃 About me

A technology enthusiast since childhood, I started using computers at the age of 6, always seeking to understand how things work and how to make everyday life easier with technology.

An open source software/hardware and hacker mindset enthusiast, I am always studying and contributing to initiatives that promote community support whenever I can.

Throughout my life, I have met truly incredible and inspiring people, from whom I have been able to broaden my knowledge in various areas, participating in Hackflags, seminars, and building challenging projects (currently a CNC).
